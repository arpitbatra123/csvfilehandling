 Mini Project 3: CSV file handling. 
 
 What is CSV file?. 
 
CSV stands for "comma-separated values‚Äù.  In CSV file each value is separated by comma. Here we have following assumption about data in CSV file .  In first row we have columns name that are separated by comma .  Form second row on-ward we contain data corresponding each columns name for Example: 

Text:
name,roll <br>
a,14 <br>
f,78 <br>

Save it as example.csv 
 
Here we call first line as Header . 
 
If you open it in spreadsheet program like Excel . it will look like as follow : 

| name | roll |
|------|------|
| a    | 14   |
| f    | 78   |

Write implementation of following operation in Either C++ or  C . 
 
 
1. Create: this function except column name as input argument and create csv file  .     Input : Name , roll_no  Output: create a csv file with Header Name and Roll_no 
 
2. IsSameStucture: Compare two CSV files whether they are same structure or not.       by same structure we mean that number column in both file is same and there is one to one mapping of column name.  

 
3. IsDuplicate: Check if Duplicate row data entries exist in CSV file. 
 
4.  RemoveDuplicate: Remove Duplicate row entry in CSV file.  
 
5. Sort: input CSV file name and column name present in CSV file structure 
   Sort the row based on the column value of the column name we enter. 
 
6. Union:  Input two CSV file name and Column name.      Union of row data based on column name and save it to another file name file3. 
 
7. Intersection:  Input two CSV file name and Column name present in both file.      Intersection of row data based on column name and save it to another file name file3
